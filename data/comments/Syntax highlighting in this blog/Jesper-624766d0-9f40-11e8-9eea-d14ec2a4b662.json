After all it had a user interface too. :O)\n\nIn the old days one-liners was only for showing off, but I think Linq has brought back one-liners as a valid approach because they are often more readable than the 5-10 lines they replace. But to be fair, in your program you showed the size of each file too. If I had brought that into play, it would have made my one-liner less readable.\n\nThank you for the plugin tip. It will definitely be useful. I am going to need that very soon.","date":"2009-03-15T16:14:43.2301547+01:00"}
