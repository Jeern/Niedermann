Last friday (the 9th) just one day before the deadline I finished my application for the [Windows 7 Contest](http://code7contest.com). "DayView" here is the description I made for the contest:

"DayView provides an overview of the appointments in all your calendars by a clever use of the Windows 7 Task bar. It shows your appointments, and you can scroll through them with toolbar buttons, and create Sticky Notes for the most important appointments. DayView uses MEF for a plugable architecture. It comes with plugins for Outlook and Sunbird."

Now I just have to wait for the evaluation the 26th of october. I have not yet decided whether I will continue working on DayView or move on to other stuff.
