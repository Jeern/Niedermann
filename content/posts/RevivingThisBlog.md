It has been 4 years since my last post, and 7 years since I posted regularly. Phew... time flies. The reason has not been a lack of subjects but more that other things were more fun, like making all sorts of games for iPhone, Apple TV, XBox and PC. I could have shared some of the experiences but I was too lazy to update the blogging tech. from the old DasBlog engine to something contemporary.

On top of all that I also had a daughter in the same period.

Excuses, excuses... 

I planned years ago to code my own blogging engine, the idea was to write markdown files to dropbox and have them appear automagically on my site. I had it all planned but never found the time, the idea was solid but too time consuming.

## Hugo to the rescue

During the summer holiday this year I fiddled around with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) almost the same idea as my own - writing blog posts in markdown though not deploying via Dropbox but via Github. 

Not as simple as my idea but actually better because of the commit log, branches etc.

I decided to transfer my old blog to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) format.

Quite time consuming in itself actually because I needed to preserve the old links, comments and so on.

But I think I am finally finished.

I will not bother you with the details - countless blog posts have been written about blogging with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The only thing I have done a little out of the ordinary is to use [Staticman](https://staticman.net) for comments, which means comments actually turns into commits to the Github repo.

The tech. used is listed on my [about]({{<ref "/About.md">}}) page

## Digging around in the old stuff

It has been a fun trip down memory lane to go through my old blog posts. Like [this one]({{<ref "/HowToUseSynologyDS213jAsAServerForGitRepositories.md">}}) in 2014 where I stated that I still prefered SVN to GIT - that was then ! Today I could not imagine going back to SVN.

Or the very [first post]({{<ref "/ThePurposeOfThisBlog.md">}}) in 2009 when I boldly promised that I would blog once per month. 

I will not make such foolhardy promises this time ! :)
