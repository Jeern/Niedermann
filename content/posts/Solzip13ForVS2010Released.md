I finally got around to upgrading and releasing Solzip for VS2010.

Solzip is a tool for zipping Visual Studio C# solutions from a right click menu in the solution explorer. You can also Zip individual projects.

You can install it from http://solzip.codeplex.com or from the Extension Manager in Visual Studio.

You can choose to install a command line version or the Visual Studio version either one that requires [MME](http://mme.codeplex.com) or a single file install which includes MME. Furthermore there is a GAX version for the ambitious.

The one you install from the Extension Manager is the single file install.

BTW: In case you did not notice I upgraded [MME](http://mme.codeplex.com) in July to enable right click menus in the code window as well as in the solution explorer.
