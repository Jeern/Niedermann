Here is my take on the Best practice Dispose pattern for most situations. It is heavily influenced by Juval LÃ¶wy from IDesigns book "Programming .NET Components", and some other sources which I no longer remember, since I made it a few years ago and have stuck to it ever since. Here it is:

```csharp
public class Class1 : IDisposable
{
    private bool m_IsDisposed;

    ~Class1()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }


    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    private void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
    {
        if (m_IsDisposed)
            return;

        if (isDisposing)
        {
            FreeManagedRessources();
        }
        FreeUnmanagedRessources();
        m_IsDisposed = true;
    }

    protected virtual void FreeManagedRessources()
    {
        //Free managed ressources here. Typically by calling Dispose on them
    }

    protected virtual void FreeUnmanagedRessources()
    {
        //Free unmanaged ressources here.
    }
} 
```

Another thing is that you can inherit the class and override the FreeManagedRessources and FreeUnmanagedRessources as needed.
