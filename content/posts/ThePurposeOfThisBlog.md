This is the first post of my new blog. Hope
you will like it. My plan is to blog about my favourite topic - .NET and other
more or less related technologies. I hope to post regularly but I will keep my
ambitions low and plan only to post once every month ! Perhaps with a larger
more in-depth blog post every second month. This is not for lack of subjects,
but because I know myself. Work, family and fitness training often comes before
late night programming and researching new stuff.

Though my mother-tongue is danish I plan to
keep this blog in English to reach a wider audience.

Take care...
