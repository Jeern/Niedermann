I like the new look and feel of IE9 but it is not without startup problems though. If you want to use Google as your favorite search provider what do you do ? Well lots of places on the web tells you to go to “Internet options” –> Change Search Defaults (Settings) and then press the lower left link “Find more search providers…”.

I did this but was perplexed. Google was not listed !

After going back and forth a few times I noticed something in the address bar.

Notice the “da” in the link. Apparently the link is dependent on your country of origin.

So I changed it to

http://www.iegallery.com/us/addons/?feature=searchproviders

And sure enough. I could now choose Google as my default search provider.

Hope this helps someone :)
