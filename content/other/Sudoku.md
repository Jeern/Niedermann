To generate a new Sudoku click the "New" button. If you want to print it click the "Print..." button to get a more printable look in a new window.

You can manipulate the size by entering the size of one box'es side. 2 equals a 4x4 sudoku. 3 a 9x9, 4 a 16x16 and so on.

You can choose the number of empty spaces either by entering it directly or choosing a level "Very Easy" to "Very Hard". You can also change it by clicking on the sudoku itself.

Update 2018: Unfortunately it is not possible to host the Silverlight Sudoku in the new Blog format. You can still download the original binaries here:
